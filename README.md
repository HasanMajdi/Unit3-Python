  ## Definition of the Problem
A Company called HOTHAT is starting to open a business, they want to sell hats and also rent them to people for a day or so. This company has a lot of hats, and thier hats have different colors, prices, and release date and due to thier client's needs they provide a specific hat that they require. 

Kelven who is the owner of HOTHAT Company emailed me to help him keep track on how his Company. He stated in his emial that his company is having a diffucult time managing to know exactly how many hat they have. Kelven stated that sometimes his company loses track on hats and for result, they lose hats in the process. Kelven is afraid that he is afraid that his company will lose a lot of money if they keep losing hats which is bad for his business. So in order for his company to run smoothly and have a easy time managing all the hats that they either sell, rent or keep, he requires an application that will solve his problems like an Inventory. To know more about kelven's request, READ Client Request  
  
  ## Client Request (Directly from His Email)
"I would like to start a business company, called Hot Hats, and in my house, I already have a set of Hats. At this instant, I do not identify a way to know the number of hats that I have. The hats present different brands, colors, and styles and popularity. Besides registering these categories, I want the program to provide the current price, release date, loan price and last time used. Additionally, I want the system to be only assessed by me or the people who would work with me"


  ## Proposed Solution
To solve HOTHAT Company's problem we need to understand and figure out what kind of inventory a company like them will need. 
A simple inventory that divides into categories and those categories will have color, price, release date, rented hats, and
last time that it have been used. To make this possible, we will divide all the hats into the categories that the company requested and some of the categories will have sub class which will make it more easier. For example, Color catergory will have a sub class that shows different colors within that category. We will also create a search button that will make everything easier for Kelven and his company. Aother feature that we will add is log in and registration so that only him or his workers could log in or use
  ## Success Criteria
  These are all the criteria that our inventory will need to have
  1. Finding how many hats the client has.
  2. Categories for Brand, color, styles, popularity.
  3. providing a price for each hat and renting price.
  4. Date that it was realesed.
  5. When it was used(Last time it was used).
  6. Log-in and register system. 
  7. Editing
  8. Images
