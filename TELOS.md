What is TELOS?

TELOS is an acronym in project management used to define five areas of feasibility that 
        determine whether a project should run or not.
        
T - Technical - Is the project technically possible?

E - Economic - Can the project be afforded? Will it increase profit?

L - Legal - Is the project legal?

O - Operational - How will the current operations support the change?

S - Scheduling - Can the project be done in time?


Regarding on the need of Kelven, I think this project is possible as we can create and meet all his requirement. According to all his details, the project could be afforded due to how cheap its and its 100% legal. I think the current operation will support the change by making it easier for the company to keep track on all their hat and keep the company running smoothly. As we have talked to kelven, the project will be done on time and it will meet all his requirement as we discussed couple time.
