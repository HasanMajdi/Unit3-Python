Question 1
A)
# This program reads two numbers and prints their sum:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
print(a + b + c)



B)
#This program read one number and prints itâ€™s square
a = int(input())
print(a*a)

C)
# Read the numbers n for number of students and k number of apples
n = int(input())
k = int(input())

# Print three statements
print(k/ n)
print(k // n)
print(k % n)

D) 
#Read an integer and write the number before and the number next
a = int(input())
# Print a value:
b = "The next number for the number " + str(a) + " is " + str(a + 1)
c = "The previous number for the number " + str(a) + " is " + str(a - 1)
print(b)
print(c)
 


E)
#this program will calculate the timestamp between two given time in sec
#Enter the first hour, minute, second
h = int(input())
m = int(input())
s = int(input())
#Enter the second hour, minute, second
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())

print((a*3600 + b*60 + c) - (h*3600 + m*60 + s))


Question 2 

A)
# this program will print the last number of a given integer
# read an integer
a = int(input())
#find the remainder
las = a % 10
print(las)

B)
#this program will find the tens digit in a number
num = int(input())
#first need to saperate the last three digits from number
tens = (num%100)
print(tens // 10)

C)
#this program will print how many day can car travel given two kilometers
from math import ceil # need to use math import ceil
n = int(input()) 
m = int(input())
days = m / n 
x = ceil(days)
print(x)

D)
# This program will determine how many hours and minutes after midnight
n = int(input())
hrs = n // 60
mins = n % 60
print(hrs, mins)







Question 3

A)
# this program will show the smallest of two given numbers
num1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
if (num1 > num2): # checking if num1 is bigger than num2
    print(num2) # if yes then bring num2 since its smaller
else:
    print(num1) # no then print num1 because its the smaller one

B)
# This program will write 1 if its positive, -1 if its negative and zero if its zero
num = int(input())

if num > 0:
    print("1")
elif num < 0:
    print("-1")
else:
    print("0")

C)
# this program will check the rook moves
num1 = int(input())
n1 = int(input())
num2 = int(input())
n2 = int(input())
if num1 == num2 or n1 == n2:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')


D)
# this program will Determine whether it is possible to split chocolate
n = int(input())
m = int(input())
k = int(input())
if k < n * m and ((k % n == 0) or (k % m == 0)):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')


Question 4

A)
#This program will print n numbers
n = int(input())
sum = 0
for i in range(n):
    sum += int(input())
print(sum)

B)
#this program will count number of zeros in a integer
numz = 0
for i in range(int(input())):
    if int(input()) == 0:
        numz += 1
print(numz)


C)
# This program will find the lost card by checking all the other cards
n = int(input())
sumc = 0
for i in range(1, n + 1):
	sumc += i
for i in range(n - 1):
	sumc -= int(input())
print(sumc)
